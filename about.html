        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Josh Solomon, and I'm student at the University of Southern California.  I'm also an engineer and cinemaphile.  I decided to create this website because it combined these two passions.  I'm not a professional critic nor do I have a degree in engineering or web-development, but I hope you enjoy my reviews and my website.</p>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, my dad took my sister and me to the movie theatre.  Every Saturday we would pack into the car and head off to see the weekly blockbuster or the newest tear-jerker or even the year's biggest flop.  To us, it didn't (and still doesn't) matter what the movie was or how much other people liked it.  All that was important was that we were able to spend time with one another and be introduced to places, peoples, ideas, and feelings that we had never seen or experienced before.  Not everyone is able to go to the movies every weekend with people they love, and I am extremely grateful that I was given that opportunity growing up.  I believe it has shaped me into the person that I am today, and I hope that by creating this website I can encourage others to share in this experience.</p>
        <p>The movie theatre has been a social, cultural, and philosophical center for the past century.  It has been a gathering place for families and communities for generations, and my family is no exception.  Please, help me to carry on this great tradition of experiencing worlds beyond our grasp with your friends and family.  Explore my website, and find your next movie.  Then, spend the next two hours with your loved ones while you all look at the world from a new point of view.  And as always, thank you for your interest in my website, movies, and the human experience.</p>
